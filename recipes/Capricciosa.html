        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>To start with, the pizza Capricciosa is an all-time favourite, known for its crispy and delectable taste. However, in this recipe, we add a unique twist that takes it to the next level. To make this fusion pizza, I enlist the help of my father-in-law, who is a maestro of pizza-making.</em></p>
        <p>Together, we gather all the ingredients needed, including mushrooms, ham, artichokes, fresh olives, and buffalo mozzarella. As we start preparing the pizza, the aroma of the toppings fills the air, making it hard to resist.</p>
        <p>With careful attention to detail, we layer the toppings on the crispy pizza base, ensuring each bite is filled with a burst of flavours. Finally, we place it in the Aussie Barbeque, cooking it to perfection. In the end, we have a mouthwatering pizza Capricciosa with a unique twist that is sure to impress your taste buds</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>240 grams Pizza Dough</li>
            <li>Slices of Ham</li>
            <li>2 sliced Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle a portion of flour over your kitchen bench and spread it using your hands.</li>
            <li>Place your dough on top of the board and using the tips of your fingers press down on it, not too hard, but don't be shy!</li>
            <li>Press down through the middle and spread the dough out. Once you have formed a circle with lots of bumps in it, turn it over, sprinkle a little more flour on the board and place it back down. You can then spread some flour on top and repeat the process.</li>
            <li>Stretch the dough out slightly using your hands, turn it once again and add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Then, if you prefer, use a rolling pin and start to stretch the dough out some more. Roll it all the way forward, then bring it all the way back.</li>
            <li>Flip your pizza dough and repeat this process.</li>
            <li>To make these even easier, get your mixing bowl, turn it upside down, pick up your dough with both hands and stretch it over the top of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Now, carefully stretch parts of the dough down using just the palm of your hand and turning the bowl around slightly bit my bit.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza base from the base of the bowl, move it from one hand to another and place it on the tray, flattening it one more time with the palm of your hands.</li>
            <li>It is now time to preheat your own at around 250 degrees.</li>
            <li>Next, sprinkle two pinches of table salt into the glass of passata and stir it with a spoon until the salt is mixed in.Also add some basil leaves.</li>
            <li>Using the same spoon, pour around 5 spoonful's of passata into the middle of the dough and spread it out using the base of the spoon, from the middle, out.</li>
            <li>Now, add the cheese on the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Than add the sliced mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Now it's time for the ham.</li>
            <li>You will have some extra passata and mushrooms left and they can be kept in the fridge to be used on something else, and if you are making another pizza, you can use them on that!</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some more Mozzarella in the middle of the pizza.</li>
            <li>Add a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil if you like.</li>
            <li>Now, put your pizza in the aussie bbq at 300C degrees or in the oven which should be heated by now at 250 degrees for ten minutes.</li>
            <li>E ora si mangia, Vincenzo's Plateâ€¦.Enjoy!</li>
