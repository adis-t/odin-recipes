        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>This grilled chicken salad is tender marinated chicken that's grilled to perfection then served over lettuce with bacon, avocado, corn, blue cheese and tomatoes. A hearty salad that's packed with flavor and also happens to be full of nutrition.</em></p>
        <p>I love a fresh and colorful salad on those days when I'm trying to eat a little lighter. Some of my favorites include Chinese chicken salad, avocado tuna salad and this easy grilled chicken salad.</p>
